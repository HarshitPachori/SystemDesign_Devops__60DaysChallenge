#### What is System Design ?
System design is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves breaking down complex problems into manageable components and outlining how they interact to achieve a desired function, considering factors like scalability, reliability, and security.


#### Why do we need System Design ?
We need system design to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. It ensures that all components work together efficiently, addresses potential bottlenecks early, facilitates collaboration among teams, and helps in making informed technology choices, ultimately leading to a successful and resilient product.


#### What is Scaling ? 
Scaling refers to the ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources.

#### Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out): Involves adding more machines or instances to your system that work together to share the load. This offers greater flexibility, fault tolerance, and typically unlimited scalability.

#### Vertical Scaling
Vertical Scaling (Scale Up): Involves increasing the capacity of a single resource, such as upgrading a server with more CPU, RAM, or storage. It's simpler but has limits.
